# GimpTweetPlugin
This is a Python Script which I wrote to generate images like tweets from certain text. This is a GIMP Plugin.
Example images can be found in this repo with filename starting with "post".

## Usage

Copy any of these plugin (.py) which you want to use under the AppData folder of GIMP inside plug-ins.
Example - C://Users/Username/AppData/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins/
Also copy dp image inside Root {C://Users/(Username)} directory.
To run, open GIMP and the go to file menu and then click Post_generator.
Results will be saved under Root directory.
